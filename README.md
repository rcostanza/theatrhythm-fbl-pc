It runs the game's own code natively on Windows and Linux, with a Vulkan renderer, keyboard and
gamepad controls, and display settings of its own. **No game files are included:** you need a decrypted
dump of your own copy of the game (PS4, version 1.00).

## Features

- **PC display settings:** windowed, borderless or fullscreen, at your desktop's resolution.
- **Keyboard and controller:** Xbox-style mapping for controllers, with the game's button hints
  redrawn for keyboard and Xbox. DualSense works too.
- **Easy setup:** point the installer at your dump, and it can add a desktop shortcut (on Linux,
  an application menu entry).
- **Custom songs:** [dlcmaker](tools/dlcmaker/README.md) turns your own music, charts and art into
  add-on packs that show up in Music Stages next to the game's DLC, on battle, event or field stages.
  It's a separate download on the releases page: `theatrhythm-dlcmaker.exe` (Windows) or
  `theatrhythm-dlcmaker.AppImage` (Linux).

## Supported languages

The game asks which language to use on first boot and offers six. English is the one played most
with this runner so far.

- ✅ English
- ✅ Japanese
- ✅ French
- ✅ German
- ✅ Italian
- ✅ Spanish
- ✅ Korean, Chinese (Traditional) and Chinese (Simplified), available via the in-game options

The game's data has Korean and Chinese text, graphics and fonts too, but the release this runner
targets (CUSA32853, built for the West) leaves them out of its language picker. The runner adds
them in the game: in **Options > Language & Menu Volume**, press left or right on **Language** to
step through all nine. The choice is saved with your game. Pressing the row still opens the game's
own picker of six. These three have been checked less than the others: the menus and the tutorial
display fully.

## Download

From the [latest release](https://github.com/YAPhoa/theatrhythm-fbl-pc/releases/latest):

- **Windows:** `theatrhythm-fbl-pc-<version>.zip`
- **Linux:** `theatrhythm-fbl-pc-<version>-linux.tar.gz`

## Requirements

- **Windows:** Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit. Python and other tools come with the release: you don't
  need to install anything else.
- **Linux:** x86-64 with glibc 2.39 or newer (SteamOS 3.7, Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 40 or
  newer, Arch) and Python 3.10 or newer (`python3`, which most distributions have) for the setup.
- A CPU with AVX
- A GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and an up-to-date driver (on Linux, Mesa or the NVIDIA driver)
- A decrypted dump of your own copy of the game: the folder with `eboot.bin`, `sce_module`,
  `sce_sys` and `Media`

### Tested on

| Part | Model |
|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 |
| RAM | 64 GB |
| OS | Windows 11 Pro |

That's far more than the game needs. It was made for a PS4, and the runner adds little on top, so
a much more modest PC should play it fine: any reasonably recent CPU with AVX and a GPU with a
current Vulkan 1.3 driver. Lower-end machines haven't been tested yet, so if yours works (or
doesn't), please say so in an [issue](https://github.com/YAPhoa/theatrhythm-fbl-pc/issues).

The Linux version is new: it has been run on Ubuntu 24.04 in WSL (software rendering, from setup
to the game's first screen) and checked on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and Arch, but not yet played on a
Linux PC with its own GPU or on a Steam Deck. If you try it there, please report how it goes.

## Install and play

1. Unzip the release anywhere, for example `C:\Games\Theatrhythm`.
2. Run `theatrhythm-setup.exe`.
3. Choose your **game folder** (the dump) and a **save folder** (by default `save` inside the
   release folder), then press **Install**. Setup prepares the game from your dump in a few
   seconds and offers a desktop shortcut. Your dump is only read, never changed.
4. Press **Play Game**. Later, start `theatrhythm-fbl.exe` or the shortcut.

Run `theatrhythm-setup.exe` again any time to change the game or save folder. It offers to copy your
saves when the save folder moves.

### On Linux

1. Extract the release anywhere you can write, for example `~/Games/Theatrhythm`:
   `tar -xzf theatrhythm-fbl-pc-<version>-linux.tar.gz -C ~/Games`
2. Run `theatrhythm-setup`: open it from your file manager and it asks with dialogs, or run
   `./theatrhythm-setup` in a terminal and it asks there. It also takes
   `--game <dump> [--save <folder>]` on the command line.
3. Pick your **game folder** (the dump) and keep or change the **save folder**. Setup prepares the
   game in a few seconds and offers an entry in your application menu.
4. Start the game from the menu entry, or run `./theatrhythm-fbl`.

On a Steam Deck, do this in Desktop Mode; then *Add a Non-Steam Game* in Steam lists the menu entry.
Shader caches are kept in `~/.cache/theatrhythm-fbl`.

### Updating

Unzip (on Linux, extract) the new release over the old folder, then run the setup once more (the
game asks you to). Your folders, saves and settings are kept.

## Settings

Setup writes `settings.ini` next to the game. It holds the window mode and size, monitor, vsync,
frame limit, audio volume and speaker layout, vibration, the dialog confirm button and control
remapping, each with a comment explaining it. A `settings.ini` in your save folder wins over it, so
your options can move with your saves; the game reads the one next to it until the save folder has
its own.

In the game, **Options > Display Settings** (an extra button below Streaming Rules) changes the
window mode, resolution, vsync, frame rate limit and render resolution. Changes apply at once and
are saved to `settings.ini` in your save folder when you leave the page. **F10** opens the same
settings in a panel with a few more (monitor, frames queued, anisotropic filtering, and the
advanced choices below).

On the **Edit party** screen, **L2** (E on the keyboard; the bar at the bottom shows it as "Rename set")
names the set you're looking at, in one of the game's own windows: type the name, then press Enter or
choose OK (Esc or Cancel keeps the old one; an
empty name clears it). Steam's on-screen keyboard opens by itself when Steam started the game in Big Picture or
Gaming Mode. The name shows above the set's number, on that screen only, up to 32 characters, in letters
the game's current font has. Names are kept in `party_names.txt` in your save folder.

**Render resolution** is 4K by default (`render_resolution=4k` in `settings.ini`): the game renders at
3840x2160, as on a PS4 Pro, and the picture is filtered down to your screen (the desktop resolution,
as the game opens borderless by default), so it's sharper on any screen. On a weaker GPU set it to
1080p, as on a PS4. It applies the next time you start the game.

### Advanced settings

The defaults are the steady ones: VSync on, one frame per refresh, no tearing. These change that
trade-off; set them in `settings.ini` or the F10 panel.

| Setting | Values | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vsync` | `1` (default), `0` | Off shows the newest finished frame at each refresh: less input delay, still no tearing. Some drivers (NVIDIA) hold it to twice the refresh rate. |
| `tearing` | `0` (default), `1` | With `vsync=0`, shows each frame the moment it is done (Vulkan Immediate). The least input delay and no frame rate ceiling, but the picture can tear. F10 shows it as VSync "Off, tearing allowed". |
| `fps_limit` | `0` (default), `30` to `240`, `unlimited` | `0` is one frame per refresh. A number caps the frame rate (with `vsync=0`). `unlimited` removes the cap: hundreds of frames a second with `tearing=1`, so the GPU runs flat out. |
| `frames_queued` | `1` (default), `2`, `0` | Frames the CPU may prepare ahead of the GPU: 1 is the lowest latency, more can smooth out a slow GPU (`0` unbounded). |
| `anisotropy` | `0` (default), `2` to `16` | Sharper textures seen at an angle. Applies at the next start. |

**Uncapped** is `vsync=0`, `tearing=1` and `fps_limit=unlimited`. A middle ground is the same with
`fps_limit=240`: most of the latency gain, with the GPU far from flat out. On a monitor at 60 Hz you
still see 60 pictures a second; what you gain is input delay.

## Controls

The game sees one DualShock 4. Any gamepad works, mapped by button position: on an Xbox pad A B X Y
are Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle; LB/RB are L1/R1, LT/RT are L2/R2, Menu is Options and View
clicks the touchpad. The keyboard and mouse work alongside a gamepad. In rhythm play any button
taps a trigger and either stick slides, so each hand gets a stick and taps:

| Keys | PS4 |
|---|---|
| W A S D / I J K L | left stick / right stick |
| arrow keys | d-pad (menus) |
| Space, Enter | Cross |
| Escape, Backspace, `;` | Circle |
| F / H | Square / Triangle |
| Q, Page Up / O, Page Down | L1 / R1 |
| E / U | L2 / R2 |
| X / M | L3 / R3 |
| Tab, P | Options |
| T | touchpad click |

Keys are physical positions, so they're the same on AZERTY or QWERTZ keyboards. To change them,
edit `key_map` and `pad_map` in `settings.ini`, e.g. `key_map=cross=G,cross=Mouse Left`: the first
mention of a button replaces its defaults, the next ones add more, and `=None` unbinds it.

On-screen button prompts follow the device you last used: PlayStation icons for a DualShock or
DualSense, Xbox icons for other gamepads, and key names for the keyboard. Set `button_icons` in
`settings.ini` to `ps4`, `xbox` or `keyboard` to keep one set.

## Issues and suggestions

Found a problem? [Open an issue](https://github.com/YAPhoa/theatrhythm-fbl-pc/issues) and attach
`theatrhythm.log` from the `log` folder in your save folder. Any suggestion, just open an issue too.
If the picture freezes, leave the game running for half a minute before you close it: after 20
seconds without a new frame it writes what every thread is doing to that log.
